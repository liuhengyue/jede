    It's "standard" in a sense that there is no ROI transform sharing
    or feature sharing between tasks.
    Each head independently processes the input features by each head's
    own pooler and head.

    This class is used by most models, such as FPN and C5.
    To implement more models, you can subclass it and implement a different
    :meth:`forward()` or a head.
